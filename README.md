# Course Tracker

## Link to Live Project - Project Still in Development

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to learn the MEAN stack and creating an industry ready project. The purpose of the project was to be used by students like myself to track their current semester course work. The project allows the student to create records of their current classes and are able to assign active homework to each class with due dates. I learned about the basics of the Angular Framework and how to use Angular Materials, how to tie in a backend (NodeJS & ExpressJS) with the frontend and make API calls. I also learn how to use JWT Authentication & Authorization, along with how to manage a NoSQL Database in MongoDB.

## Usage

Register a new account with your email and password. When you log in you are brought to the tracker page and prompted to add courses. Once you add courses, you can go back to the course tracker page and the table will be availble for you to add, edit and delete course work.
